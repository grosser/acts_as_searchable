*SVN*

* Improved compatibility with Rails' pagination feature, <tt>Model::fulltext_search</tt> now takes a <tt>:count</tt> parameter which will return the number of matches for your query instead of retrieving the actual documents and instantiating the results.

* Added compatibility with Rails' STI feature. The base class of an inherited model is stored in the type_base attribute, so please reindex your STI models after applying this update. After that, the following is possible (presuming <tt>CommentNotification</tt> descends from <tt>Notification</tt>):

    CommentNotification.fulltext_search('') # Returns all indexed CommentNotification records
    Notification.fulltext_search('')        # Returns both CommentNotification records and Notification
                                            # records as well as any other indexed child objects

* Force query conditions to support HE's simple format. Queries like these work now:

    Article.fulltext_search('mau*')         # Matches 'mau' at the beginning of a word
    Article.fulltext_search('*ris')         # Matches 'ris' at the end of a word
    Article.fulltext_search('*^m.*is$*')    # Regular expression to match words that begin with 'm' and end in 'is'

*0.1.0*

* Initial release
